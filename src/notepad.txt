//blogsSlice.js
Initial State: Defines the initial state of the blogs slice, including loading, error, posts, and post properties.

Create Slice: Utilizes createSlice from Redux Toolkit to define a slice of the Redux state named "blogs". It initializes with the initialState and an empty reducer field.

Extra Reducers: Uses extraReducers to handle asynchronous actions dispatched by Redux Thunk or other middleware.

Each builder.addCase statement corresponds to a different action type (pending, fulfilled, rejected) for various asynchronous actions like adding a blog, fetching all blogs, updating a blog, etc.
These cases update the loading state based on the action status, update the posts or post state with new data when fetching or adding posts, and handle errors if any.
Export: Export the reducer function generated by createSlice. This reducer is then combined with other reducers in the Redux store setup.

//store.js
Import Statements:

Import the configureStore function from @reduxjs/toolkit.
Import the slices (reducers) from their respective files.
Configure Redux Store:

Use the configureStore function to create the Redux store.
Inside the configureStore function:
Pass an object with a reducer key that contains the combined reducers.
Each reducer is responsible for managing a specific slice of the application state.
In this case, the application has three main slices: likes, blogs, and myFavorites.
Each slice is managed by its corresponding reducer: likesSlice, blogsSlice, and myFavoriteSlice.
Middleware:

Middleware intercepts actions before they reach the reducers, allowing for additional functionality.
In this configuration, getDefaultMiddleware is called to retrieve the default middleware provided by Redux Toolkit.
The serializableCheck middleware option is set to false to disable the serializable check warning. This is done because Redux Toolkit's createSlice function automatically generates action creators and reducers that are not serializable by default, and it's safe to ignore the warning in this case.
In summary, this code sets up the Redux store for the application, combines the reducers responsible for managing different parts of the application state, and applies middleware to enhance Redux functionality while ignoring the serializable check warning for non-serializable data.

blogAction.jsThunk Action Creators: These are functions created using createAsyncThunk from Redux Toolkit.
Action Types: Each thunk action creator defines an action type to identify the action in the Redux store.
Payload Creator Functions: These functions define how to create the payload that will be dispatched along with the action.
Async Operations: Inside each thunk action creator, asynchronous operations such as making HTTP requests using Axios are performed to interact with the server.
Logging Responses: Each action creator logs the response received from the server for debugging purposes.
Return Data: The data returned by the server response is used as the payload of the action and is made available to the reducer to update the Redux store.

// docker description //

Here's how the Dockerfile works:

It starts from the official Node.js Docker image, which provides a base environment for running Node.js applications.
Sets the working directory inside the container to /app.
Copies package.json and package-lock.json files into the container.
Installs the dependencies using npm install.
Copies the rest of your application code into the container.
Builds the React app using npm run build.
Exposes port 3000, which is the default port for React apps.
Defines the command to start the application using npm start.
