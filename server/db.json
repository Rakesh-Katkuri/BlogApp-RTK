      "title": "Wild Wonders: Mushrooms",
      "description": "The Fungi Kingdom is a fascinating and somewhat mysterious category of organisms, home to yeasts, molds, lichen, and of course mushrooms. While fungi may generally have a less than glamorous reputation as “decomposers,” this incredibly diverse grouping of organisms has given humankind food like bread, wine, and cheese – as well as medicine like the antibiotic penicillin.\n\nI first became fascinated by fungi in a lab biology course at the Santa Rosa Junior College, in which we learned about the evolution and ecology of fungi while also examining specimens under microscopes. I invite you to explore outside and see what fungi friends share your neighborhood during the different times of the year. Look closely around the base of trees, and along the trunks of older and dying trees to see who has emerged after the rains. You may be surprised by all the shapes, sizes and colors you find; and perhaps you too will be inspired to learn more about these mysterious friends that follow our winter rains.\n\nAs your curiosity grows and you want to learn more, hop on iNaturalist.org to share your photographs. Most likely, a mighty mycologist (someone who studies fungus) will post a suggested identification of your find. I highly recommend the downloadable phone app, and am myself an avid user of iNaturalist. This free community-based science platform is an excellent resource to learn about all kinds of creatures near you. There is also a friendly annual iNaturalist competition known as the City Nature Challenge coming up on April 28-30. Make a long weekend of posting nature observations wherever you happen to be, or consider joining us at Pepperwood for an in-person bioblitz!\n\nFun Fungal Facts\nThe fungi body is made up of a network of tiny filaments called hyphae. Mycelium is an interwoven mass of fungal hyphae. Next time you dig up a mushroom or turn over a rotting log, look for loose white threads, this is mycelium! \nThe cell walls are made out of chitin which provides strength and flexibility. Chitin also makes up the exoskeletons of insects and arthropods. \nMushrooms are like the apple you pick off of an apple tree – the fruiting body. The “tree” of the mushroom is the mycelium that is underground.\nAbout 95% of flowering plants have a mutually beneficial relationship with fungi! These fungi are called mycorrhizae and they attach to plant roots helping to more efficiently acquire minerals from the soil in exchange for carbohydrates from the plant roots.\nWhat’s in a name? Mycorrhizae is Greek for fungus root: “myco” means fungus and “rhizas” means root\nYeast are very important economically especially here is agriculture focused Sonoma County. Without our yeast friends we would not be able to make beer and wine.\nFungi are essential decomposers. They play a key role in our world because they break down organic matter into bits and pieces that are then useable by other organisms. \nGlobally over 100,000 fungi species have been identified and named; but there are likely closer to 1.5 million fungi species in our world!\nCan you identify any of the mushrooms pictured below, based on their description?\nBird’s nest fungi (genus Nidulariaceae). The family name comes from Nidulus which means “small nest” in Latin, and indeed these small fungi resemble a small bird’s nest filled with eggs! The “nest” is actually the reproductive structure for this saprotrophic fungi (meaning “feeding on organic matter”) so they are typically found on decomposing wood or in this case on an old Douglas-fir cone. The “eggs” are actually spore packets. When a raindrop lands in the cup at just the right angle, those spore packets are splashed out and dispersed out into the world to continue their lifecycle.\n\nShaggy mane (genus Coprinus). These mushrooms can change their appearance quite quickly. In a matter of hours they can go from looking pristine and solid to a black gooey mess. Why? Because they liquify their gills in order to more effectively disperse the spores on the underside of their caps. This process is what gives this mushroom another name, “Inky Cap.” Like the bird’s nest, this fungus is a saprobe, meaning it feeds on dead organic matter like wood chips, decomposing logs, or piles of forest litter.\n\nTurkey tail fungi (Trametes versicolor). This mushroom is ubiquitous throughout North American forests, and you’ve probably run into it before. Like the previous two mushrooms, it is saprotrophic and is found on dead logs and stumps. It grows in overlapping clusters, and its upper surface can be a variety of colors. In fact, its name “versicolor” means “of several colors.” Do you notice the concentric lines of color?\n\nWestern black elfin saddle (Helvella vespertina). Look for these friends underneath conifers like Douglas-fir trees throughout the Pacific Northwest. The cap is black to dark gray with an irregular shape; the stem has ribs and pockets and is whitish, darkening with age.\n\nOrange peel fungus (Aleuria aurantia). A cup shaped fungus that is initially round, but as it develops the margin (edge of the cup) will get wavy and eventually split. It’s commonly found growing along disturbed paths or even rocky soils. Look for these friends growing in clusters on the ground both locally here in California, but also Asia, Europe and throughout North America!\nIts name says it all.",

      "title": "CAL FIRE VLOG – Prescribed Burn at Pepperwood Monday 11/21",
      "description": "CAL FIRE Sonoma-Lake-Napa Unit, in partnership with Pepperwood, conducted a 38-acre prescribed burn on the reserve Monday, November 21. The project size targeted treatment of up to 38 acres to promote healthy forests and reduce wildfire risk on a strategic fire control ridge separating Franz Valley and the Mark West area.\n\nIn the below video by CAL FIRE Sonoma Lake Napa Unit, Sonoma County Fire Chief Marshall Turbeville breaks down prescribed fire: what it entails, why we do it, and what stewardship we do alongside it. Chief Turbeville notes the burn intensity of this particular controlled fire and points out how hard the firefighters had to work just to get the fire to take after the soils had been saturated by winter rains. This compares with prescribed fires that took place on the property before the first rains at the end of October, which were notably more effective in reducing fuel loads.",

      "title": "A Year in the Life: of a Grizzly Corps Research Tech",
      "description": "My name is Makayla Freed, and I’m Pepperwood’s Research Technician. In September, I celebrated one year at Pepperwood as a GrizzlyCorps Fellow. GrizzlyCorps is an AmeriCorps program created by UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy & the Environment, which gives college graduates the opportunity to do important work promoting regenerative agriculture and/or fire and forest resilience.\n\nAlthough my time at Pepperwood started way back in the fall of 2016, I hopped on board full-time in September 2021 as a GrizzlyCorps Fellow after years of volunteering, interning, and working seasonally at the reserve. The Fellowship has allowed me to take on a full-time role on Pepperwood’s Research and Preserve Management (RPM) team, working with the research folks on a variety of projects.\n\nIn the past year, I’ve been in over my hard hat in forest monitoring, grassland monitoring, bear scat surveys, and much much more. I’ve learned an enormous amount about forest monitoring protocols, serviced wildlife cameras for Pepperwood’s Wildlife Picture Index (WPI) project, and collected phenological data for the Phenology Project, all while gaining a unique perspective of the great deal of work Pepperwood’s RPM team does to steward and monitor the land and wildlife. This year, I will continue in the same role, but will take on more responsibilities with several projects including the Phenology Project and the forest monitoring projects.",

      "title": "Art-inspired Connections to Nature",
      "description": "I see art as a key to the health of our nation and our culture. It is a means of communing with the sacred essence of our planet and is foundational to everything I do at Pepperwood. I have the honor of being a member of Pepperwood’s Art Committee – working to create space for a wide range of art forms to be featured throughout the reserve, including sculpture, creative writing, film, photography, basketry, and more. We’re moving into a unique role of shaping a necessary culture change alongside the other elements of our Strategic Plan 2020-2025.\n\nAmericans simply must evolve greater environmental awareness. Our very survival depends upon our willingness to achieve harmony with our natural world. Art is key in communicating and expanding this environmental awareness while fostering a sense of the sacred essence of our Earth.\n\nTo nurture cultural evolution, our Gallery exhibits will continue to showcase spectacular creations including landscape painting, Native basketry, and wildlife photography. More sculpture, in a variety of forms, will grace our Dwight Center and beyond. Catherine Daley (left) is now preparing another one of her kinetic pieces for the front of the Dwight Center while a large circular installation by Jann Nunn (middle) is planned for a space in the field below, and Briona Hendren’s (right) sculpture Headspace can be found at the center of the native plant garden. On a spectacular vista site, above the Bechtel House, a 40’ stone meditation labyrinth will be created by Catherine Daley with Pepperwood community involvement.\n\nDiscussions are also in process regarding a Sonoma County-wide sculpture event in 2023 and 2024 with five different art venues in Petaluma, Sonoma, Santa Rosa, and at Pepperwood. In art planning at this level, the Art Committee is committed to placing sculpture in a way that does not interfere with Nature, but rather helps the viewer to segue into a deeper understanding and appreciation of the natural world.\n\nThe art focus at Pepperwood will soon also encourage underrepresented groups and emerging artists via a partnership with Creative Sonoma. ArtSurround, a new collaborative effort among the public, private, and nonprofit sectors to enhance Sonoma County’s creative vitality by supporting artists and infusing the arts into our public realm, will bring to Pepperwood multiple artists including writers, a paper artist, and a graphic artist to enjoy a symposium at our Bechtel House. Their artistic interaction and creative experience will be documented by a filmmaker.\n\nThe arts at Pepperwood will continue to enhance our visitors’ experience connecting with nature as we expand the scope of these presentations. Art offers a beautiful, dynamic, and hopeful endeavor for our future. I am honored to be part of these endeavors and the Pepperwood family.",

      "title": "Linking Local to Global ",
      "description": "Greetings from Australia, dear Community! In 2020, you may recall that I was selected to be a Global Fulbright Fellow, enabling me to travel around the world to different Mediterranean biomes. The focus of this quest was to link our work in California to the work of our global partners facing similar challenges around droughts, floods, fires, and threats to biodiversity.\n\nKey to this opportunity was the generous hospitality of Dr. Sally Thompson, one of the founding members of our Terrestrial Biodiversity and Climate Change Collaborative (TBC3). Originally from Perth, Australia, Dr. Thompson was faculty at UC Berkeley when we started TBC3 and has now returned to her homeland to lead endeavors seeking to better understand the impacts of climate change on the water balance and ecosystems across the country. Like Pepperwood, Sally is spearheading a long-term monitoring approach that utilizes the multifaceted value of a Sentinel Site. In advance of my arrival to Perth, Sally facilitated numerous connections with academic, agency, and NGO leaders working within the realm of building landscape resilience.\n\nSince my departure to Australia in late June, my trip has been nonstop. What stands out to me, midway through these travels, are the numerous parallel efforts taking place here down under. For instance, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network O2 Flux Tower (pictured at right) is, like our Flux Towers, measuring the energy, carbon, and water exchange between the atmosphere and ecosystems. This opportunity has allowed me to step outside of my usual routine, creating space for me to fit what we do at Pepperwood within a global context.\n\nAfter so long working in isolation, it came as somewhat of a surprise to me how eager others were to connect and share research and stewardship. I’m so grateful to the many different hosts and practitioners who are stepping out of their own routine to engage with me, ensuring that my time here is well-spent. And I’m grateful to the Pepperwood team for supporting me in this travel opportunity – I couldn’t be here without them.\n\nWe, as a global community, are up against incredible odds. Regional approaches that directly engage communities are the way forward, but uniting with our global partners reinforces our efforts, enables the sharing of innovation, and allows us to effectively monitor the planet. I look forward to unfolding the stories of my Fulbright Fellowship to you over the next few months.",

      "title": "Developing Geologic Thought",
      "description": "I once wrote: “Scientific knowledge can lead to adaptations, and these are best accomplished by first fostering a receptive attitude not only for scientific data, but for an emotional awareness of the natural world. Only then can there be a base for understanding the ramifications of our actions, and to act towards environmental justice.” Let me break this down.\n\nTake the word “science”, which is being bandied about and even attacked these days. It is from the Latin “scientia” meaning knowledge. A simple definition, then, would be that science is the search for knowledge. Emotional awareness implies that observations are made and thought is given to those observations. Nothing else is as important to the natural sciences as observation and thought about what was observed.\n\nThe natural world is the Earth itself and it’s history. Earth has a long history, in the vicinity of five thousand million years, aka five billion. Land masses, oceans, and atmospheres have changed multiple times, so thinking about and imagining processes that have sculpted the Earth over time is a daunting but necessary task to understanding life on Earth. Here is where the geological sciences shine. The emphasis is on geological processes OVER TIME and how they influenced life OVER TIME. These processes have been and continue to be at the base of life on Earth. But, what if I am not a geologist or interested in rocks?\n\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Summer Swallow\n\nIt does not take a geology degree to think geologic thoughts. What are some of the geological words you already know, such as faults, landslides, outcrops, sediment, rock, etc.? Now give those words more meaning, and think about WHAT they each are, WHERE they occur, WHEN they took or take place, and HOW they came to be. Use your imagination and then a dictionary (or google!). This is a way to build upon geologic thought without a whole lot of effort.",

      "title": "In Search of Monarch Butterflies",
      "description": "Pepperwood Visiting Scholar & PhD Candidate, Population Biology, UC Davis\n\nI am a second year PhD student at UC Davis in the Population Biology program. One of my major research interests is understanding how interactions between monarch butterflies and milkweed might be contributing to the population fluctuations that the western monarch population has experienced in the past decade. I was initially connected with Pepperwood Preserve by Shane Waddell, the manager of the UC Quail Ridge Natural Reserve, who suggested that it might be a good place to find research-protected native milkweed in the northern coast range.\n\nI plan to investigate how the timing of monarchs migrating inland corresponds to the timing of milkweed availability in the early spring. Specifically, I’m curious if monarchs might, in some years, arrive to some locations in the northern coast range earlier in the spring than natural milkweed is available. Pepperwood is an ideal location to answer this question since it is in a region of the coast range where monarchs may make their first stop, and since it has natural populations of native narrowleaf milkweed (Asclepias fascicularis).\n\nI will address this question using potted milkweed plants to monitor for the presence of monarchs. I will bring potted milkweed plants into the field in early spring, which I will monitor weekly for monarch eggs and larvae. I’ll also monitor the phenology of natural milkweed plants at Pepperwood. If we observe monarch eggs or larvae on the potted milkweed plants before natural milkweed plants have grown large enough to support a monarch caterpillar, that may be an indication that monarchs are limited by milkweed availability in the early spring, at least in some years. My observations at Pepperwood will be paired with similar observations at two other sites, the UC McLaughlin Natural Reserve also in the north Coast Range, and the Putah Creek Riparian Reserve near Davis, CA.",

      "description": "My name is Summer Swallow, and I never expected I’d become a teacher. Now that I am one, I can’t imagine doing anything else. When you’re an environmental educator, every day is an adventure. Especially when one is fortunate enough to have a classroom like Pepperwood, a 3,200-acre expanse of land that is perpetually ripe for exploration. Yet, what I love most about teaching is that whether I’m working with second graders or grandparents (or anyone in between), I am always learning something from my students. \n\nOur community of learners at Pepperwood constantly keep me on my toes. Imagine this: we’re walking along the Ono Shi trail, and a garter snake slithers across the path and into the grass, catching the eye of several 4th grade SCENIQ students. Calmly pointing to this reptile friend, one student matter-of-factly shares with us “did you know that snakes overwinter underground.” For the rest of our hike, holes in the ground take on a whole new and intriguing meaning for the entire group.  \n\nAnother day, at Pepperwood Creek with a TeenNat alumni group, a TeenNat youth asks, “how old are the rocks in this creek?” What a brilliant question, as I mentally thumb through my geology notes. Not wanting to take their question for ‘granite,’ I reply “That’s a great research question we can look up. While we’re standing here, what do you notice about these rocks and the surrounding landscape?” \n\nOn another hike with a 3rd grade SCENIQ class, students excitedly point out a blue-belly lizard, “why is it doing push-ups?” Have you ever seen this and wondered what they are doing? “Hmm, perhaps it’s an arms day, and they are working on their biceps,” I say. Later I’ll reveal that there are a few known options: it might be a mating display, or it could be territorial performance as they guard their favorite sunning spot. \n\nOn a recent Saturday morning, I posed questions to the adult participants of our UCANR California Naturalist certification course: \n\nWhy are plants essential to life? \n\nWhat is conifer encroachment? How can this impact ecosystem health? \n\nWhy is stewarding native perennial grasslands important?” \n\nThese are big questions with a myriad of potential answers and perspectives. Questions like these spark deep conversations, bouts of wonder, and precious moments of connection with the natural world that sustains us. ",

That sounds like a house, a place of worship, a city; the ultimate self-absorption of the Anthropocene\nThe phenology trail we walked so many times our feet carried us to each plant without a misstep. Thoughtfully, we wrote down prescribed observations; leaf buds, new leaves, flower buds, flowers and then the predictable decay\nThrough a lens of projection we gave one plant a high five, the next a sad face, the third a pep talk and the fourth no hope.  Reminded of our Citizen Scientist duties we pulled aside our personal veil and stretched for objectivity\nThen there was the fire.  So hot and so fierce, this trail we walked so many times our feet carried us to each plant without a misstep, had disappeared.  The plants vaporized, every sweet landmark gone\nAt once the intense parameter of our focus moved from the story of the path and the plants to the suddenly wide-open and unfamiliar horizon.

Do we leave it alone and let it heal from the decades of slow and incessant human subjectivity?",

After reading an inspiring article in a local newspaper and volunteering for a work day, I wanted to learn more about becoming a Pepperwood Steward. One step in the process is to complete Bio 85 – Natural History of Pepperwood, a two-semester course offered by the Santa Rosa Junior College and Pepperwood.\n\nIn class, we learned the valuable technique of nature journaling. Through journaling, I found that taking in the beauty of nature is greatly enhanced. I get to re-experience what I see, hear and think about in the field. According to renowned naturalist, educator and artist, John Muir Laws, “observing and journaling will slow you down and make you stop, sit down, look and look again.” It’s the closer look that helps you go deeper and see the wondrous intricacies that you might otherwise miss.",
